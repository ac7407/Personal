Hi there. 
Welcome to my Portfolio. 
I am currently taking a course on Computational Physical Chemistry where I hope to gain a lot of experience in molecular modeling and in data analysis. This repository will be continuously updated so please stay tuned. 
If you're reading this, I hope you have a very nice day.
